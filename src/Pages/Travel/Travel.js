            <h3 className="my-3">River Tips</h3>
            <p>Bangladesh has more than 8,000km of navigable waterways and boarding a boat along a river is a quintessential Bangladesh experience. The most famous boat trip is aboard the old paddle-wheel cruiser known as The Rocket – Dhaka to Khulna is popular (although water levels are too low to go all the way to Khulna this year) – and of course your Sundarbans tiger trip will be by boat. But there are plenty of other, lesser-known trips you can take in pretty much any corner of the country. Even if you’re not going anywhere in particular, you can just rock up at most river ghats and negotiate a fare with a boat-hand for a one-hour tour of the river. You’ll have to have your best miming skills at the ready because it’s very unlikely your boat-hand will speak any English…but it all adds to the adventure.</p>

            <h3>Riding</h3>

            <p>Of course there are cycle rickshaws in many parts of the world, especially south Asia, but in Bangladesh they are arguably more colourful, more prevalent and more integral to everyday life than in any other place on earth. Designs are an art form in their own right – you can even take home painted panels of rickshaws as souvenirs – and riders take great pride in making theirs look best. Almost every town and city has a huge fleet and it’s pretty much impossible to avoid travelling on one at some stage of your Bangladesh trip. And why would you want to avoid it? They’re cheap, fun, environmentally friendly and are often the quickest way to get through the busy streets.</p>

            <h3 className="my-3">Tea state</h3>

            <p>Predominantly agricultural, Bangladesh is rural bliss for many travellers and wherever you go you’ll enjoy vistas that are beautifully lush and wonderfully green. Nowhere is this more the case than in the gentle hills of the northeast. This is Sylhet, Bangladesh’s prime tea-growing region and a visit here offers the chance to escape the heat of the plains and a stroll around tea-growing estates before putting your feet up with a top-class cuppa. The most popular place to use as a base for your tealeaf explorations is Srimangal.</p>
